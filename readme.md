# get Started

run ``npm i`` then ``npm run setup`` insert your token in the .env file in root folder. Then run ``npm start``


## what is this!? 
Bot randomly picks mp3 files from folder and plays them randomly in joined server.

It only joins voice channels that arent empty and it plays a sound with a interval of 10 min to 12 hours. 
This might be effected by how many servers it has joined.


## but why

this is rushed like crazy, did this in 30-40min but should work, for now until discord updates their api and stuff


## misc

inv link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_APPLICATIONID]&scope=bot&permissions=2184391704 if you place your token in the .env file, once the bot start youll get the full inv link in the terminal.
