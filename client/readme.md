### Webserver
A simple webserver for managing sounds played by the bot. 

``I havent paid much attention to this and it can be refactored, rewritten and just more structured. I didn't feel like i bothered too much so i gave it minimal attention and left it at "I just works" stage.``


//Feels weird to write basic js in the browser since it was so long ago..


## How it works, 
the bot should give you an address on startup, but if you miss it, it should be http://localhost:8080 if you host it somewhere its the ip-address of the server instead of localhost.

i tested ``foundation`` because the sake of it for the design, i dont think i will use it again on a project.
